## Overview

The Cognitive Architecture is a series of layers designed to create a "Cognition-Driven Application." This replaces traditional routing and menus with a system that understands user intent and system context.

## Core Pillars

1. **[Intent & Context Modeling](intent-context.md)**  
   *Persisting and evolving a first-class representation of user intent.*

2. **[Directed Graph Engine](directed-graph-engine.md)**  
   *Evaluating eligibility and enforce human-defined constraints.*

3. **[AI Orchestration](ai-orchestration.md)**  
   *Structuring AI decisions WITHOUT giving it control over UI or business rules.*

4. **[Story Rendering](story-rendering.md)**  
   *Morping UI state transitions instead of "jumping" between routes.*

5. **[Attention & Noise Governance](attention-governor.md)**  
   *The system-level governor that ensures the AI knows when to stay quiet.*

6. **[Auditability & Replay](decision-auditability.md)**  
   *Tracking the "Why" behind every system-led decision.*
